###Background
I build this application to emulate Trello's functionality. This application connects to the react-trello-back-end for server functionality which can be seen here: (https://github.com/jayzamazing/react-trello-back-end).

###Use Case
This application could be useful both at work and everyday life. A person could create a variety of different lists such as a shopping list, things to do list, or a place to keep track of projects.

###Initial UX
The initial web and mobile wireframes are shown below:

###Development Roadmap
This is v4.2.1 of the app. Future enhancements can be seen below:
